         <h2>Muse</h2>
         <p>Muse is hard to categorize into a single genre of music. They are very experimental and not afraid of taking risks. All of their songs have a great deal of meaning behind them, covering topics from war to love. The album below is one of my all-time favorites. </p>

            <h2>Avenged Sevenfold</h2>
            <p>Like Muse, Avenged Sevenfold (A7X) is very hard to fit into a single category. Each album sounds unique and unlike any other band. On surface level, they may seem like every other rock band, but delve a little deeper and you will see how vulnerable they are with their audience and just how relatable the songs can be. A prime example of this is their fifth album 'Nightmare'.;</p>
