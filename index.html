         <h2>Muse</h2>
         <p>Muse is hard to categorize into a single genre of music. They are very experimental and unafraid of taking risks. All of their songs have an interesting story being told, covering topics from war to love. The album below is easily one of my all-time favorites. Each song is like its own small universe; one composition makes you feel like an epic space cowboy, while the next makes you contemplate the stability of our nation. </p>

            <h2>The Strokes</h2>
            <p>I don't listen to The Strokes as much as I once did, but I will always appreicate the band for playing a major role in the formation of my musical taste. They fit under a genre known as alternative rock. When I listen to this band, I don't look for too much meaning behind the lyrics, but even so, their songs hold a considerable amount of original and well thought out word-play. 'Angles' is an extremely catchy album and I absolutely adore it.  </p>

            <h2>Avenged Sevenfold</h2>
            <p>Like Muse, Avenged Sevenfold (A7X) is very hard to fit into a single category. Each album sounds unique and unlike any other band. On surface level, they may seem like every other rock band, but delve a little deeper and you will see how vulnerable they are with their audience and just how relatable the songs can be. A prime example of this is their fifth album 'Nightmare'; it explores concepts such as death and grief.</p>
